Your privacy is critically important to us. This document states what data we collect during Memo's usage and why we 
collect it. We aim to for full transparency about what data we collect during the app usage, how it's collected and how
we use it.

# What Information We Collect

- **Crash logs**: We collect crash logs when the application crashes due to an unknown reason. This logs includes 
information about your device (model, running operational system), application usage information (stack trace in the 
crash moment, which includes the visible screens) and the date when the crash happened.
- **Usage information**: We collect information about the application usage, such as the device information (model, screen 
size, running operation system, etc.). We also collect information about date and time of access, which screens you've
visited during the app usage, etc.

# How We Collect These Information

This information is automatically collected using [Firebase Analytics SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics) 
and is 100% anonymized, which means that we **can't** link these information with you in any way. We have explicitly 
disabled [personalized advertising features](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/configure-data-collection?platform=android#configure_the_use_of_data)
and [IDFA collection](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/configure-data-collection?platform=ios#disable-IDFA-collection).

The analytics data is not collected with a commercial intention. Our goal is to use the data to improve the overall 
application usage and experience.

# How We Use These Information

We use these data to improve the application usage to all users. The crash logs help use to identify errors in run-time,
so we can fix it in future releases. The usage information help us create usage metrics about the overall behavior 
across the application, like the most visited screens, and to identify usability problems.
